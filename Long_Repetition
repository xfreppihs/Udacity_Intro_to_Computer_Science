# Question 8: Longest Repetition

# Define a procedure, longest_repetition, that takes as input a 
# list, and returns the element in the list that has the most 
# consecutive repetitions. If there are multiple elements that 
# have the same number of longest repetitions, the result should 
# be the one that appears first. If the input list is empty, 
# it should return None.

def longest_repetition(lst):
    if not lst:
        return None
    element = lst[0]
    longest = 1
    stretch = 1
    for i in range(len(lst)-1):
        if lst[i] == lst[i+1]:
            stretch += 1
            if stretch > longest:
                longest = stretch
                element = lst[i]
        else:
            stretch = 1
    return element
            

#For example,

print longest_repetition([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1])
# 3

print longest_repetition(['a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd'])
# b

print longest_repetition([1,2,3,4,5])
# 1

print longest_repetition([])
# None
